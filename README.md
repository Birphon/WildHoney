All Unpaid for - I do not have the funds to be able to pay for work, sadly - this will be a passion project that everyone that has worked on can use in terms of Portfolio Work for job applications.

## Open Source
This project will be handed in an semi-open source manor where all assets are made for this project and this project alone however the project is open for people to work on - an example would be if the developers have stopped playing/no longer interested in Wilds that this project can be easily taken over to continue its development


This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
